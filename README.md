# Requesting replication packages via email

In 2016, we wanted to find out how successful we might be in requesting replication packages via email. We picked a journal that had a policy requiring that authors cooperate with replication attempts, but that did not require that authors deposit their materials with the journal or any other archive. We picked the Industrial and Labor Relations Review, a good journal with a strong empirical component. We did not request permission from the journal to conduct this experiment, nor did we ask them to collaborate, since we wanted an objective but comprehensive outcome.

## Process

We created a generic (group) email address on Gmail. Since most of the work was being done by undergraduates, and we wanted to convey the level of expertise present in the group, the email identified us as a "group of undergraduates." One of the undergraduate team members monitored the email, under supervision of a graduate student. 

```
Dear <<Author1>>,

We are a group of undergraduate students, working on a paper replication 
project at the Labor Dynamics Institute. Our goal is to replicate a 
series of articles in the Industrial and Labor Relations Review (ILRR). 
As part of the project, we are trying to replicate your paper “<<Title>>,“
which was published in the ILRR in <<year>> 
(vol <<volume>>, no. <<no.>>). 

We are contacting you in the hope that you would be able to share your
data and programs with us, if possible. Any means of sharing - Dropbox 
share, archive on a home page, etc. - works for us. 

Our summer project ends soon, and we would very much appreciate it if you
could respond as soon as possible so we can get started. However, other
students will pick up the project in the Fall semester, and you can 
correspond with our entire team at our group email <<Replicator_email>>.

If you have any questions or concerns, please do contact me at <<Replicator_email>>.

Sincerely,

<<Replicator>>

## Outcomes 

We were primarily interested in whether or not we could actually obtain materials. When we did receive materials, we did not actually verify reproducibility. Thus the key outcomes are the effectiveness of the email request. 

## Ethics approval

We inquired with the IRB at Cornell University. Because we are using publicly available emails posted in compliance with a public policy, and because we were interested in the outcome of the process, our study was not categorized as "human subjects research". In order to stay within that process, we have removed the actual email addresses, author names, and any content associated with the email response from the data. It is, of course, relatively straightforward to re-obtain the email addresses and names by using the (public) CrossRef database for the recorded DOI for each article. 

## Processing

At this point, we are only interested in the overall response rate. All the data, and the very simple calculation, are in a spreadsheet (originally maintained on Google Sheets). Calculcations are on sheet "Some statistics".

## License

We are currently not licensing the data we collected more broadly, as we still intend to use the data in a publication. We expect to license the data upon first publication under a CC-BY-NC license.
