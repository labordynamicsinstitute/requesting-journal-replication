Dear <<Author1>>,


We are a group of undergraduate students, working on a paper replication project at the Labor Dynamics Institute. Our goal is to replicate a series of articles in the Industrial and Labor Relations Review (ILRR). As part of the project, we are trying to replicate your paper “<<Title>>,“ which was published in the ILRR in <<year>> (vol <<volume>>, no. <<no.>>). 


We are contacting you in the hope that you would be able to share your data and programs with us, if possible. Any means of sharing - Dropbox share, archive on a home page, etc. - works for us. 


Our summer project ends soon, and we would very much appreciate it if you could respond as soon as possible so we can get started. However, other students will pick up the project in the Fall semester, and you can correspond with our entire team at our group email <<Replicator_email>>.


If you have any questions or concerns, please do contact me at <<Replicator_email>>.


Sincerely,


<<Replicator>>
